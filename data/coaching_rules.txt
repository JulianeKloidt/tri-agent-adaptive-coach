RULE: THE 80/20 RATIO
80% of weekly training volume must be at low intensity (Zone 2). Only 20% should be high intensity. 
If an athlete's Fatigue (ATL) is rising too fast, reduce the 20% high-intensity sessions to 0%.

RULE: SWIM FOR RECOVERY
When Training Stress Balance (TSB) drops below -25, the next scheduled hard run should be 
replaced by a 45-minute technique-focused swim. Swimming provides non-weight-bearing 
blood flow which aids recovery.

RULE: THE 10% VOLUME CAP
Never increase the total weekly duration by more than 10% compared to the previous week. 
This is the primary way to prevent overuse injuries in triathletes.
